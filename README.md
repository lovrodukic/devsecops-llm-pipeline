# DevSecOps Secure CI/CD/LLM Workflow

This project is a **DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations) pipeline**
designed to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced security checks.
The pipeline automates infrastructure deployment using Infrastructure as Code
(IaC) principles and incorporates AI to identify and mitigate security risks
before deployment.

## To Do:
- Incorporate LLM trigger for scanning security vulnerabilities and code review.
- Store vulnerability report as an artifact
- Test `scan.py` and OpenAI API for check
- Test CI/CD pipeling with automated LLM code review / vulnerability check.

## Technologies
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, Terraform
- **Generative AI**: LLMs, OpenAI API
- **Languages**: Python, HCL
